# Speech-Commands-Classifier

This repository demonstrates both the training and inference processes of a neural network model developed using the Speech Commands dataset from torchaudio: [SpeechCommands Dataset](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/generated/torchaudio.datasets.SPEECHCOMMANDS.html#torchaudio.datasets.SPEECHCOMMANDS). The dataset consists of approximately 100,000 recordings across 35 different classes.

The model is impressively compact, containing around 600,000 parameters and weighing only 2.5 MB, yet it delivers solid performanceâ€”achieving 91% accuracy on the validation set and 88% on the test set.

The trained model is also included in the repository. You can try it out by running the `inference.ipynb` notebook, speaking the commands via your microphone, and seeing the classification results.
